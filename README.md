# TensorTrain-Greedy-Cross

Python implementation of Algorithm 2 in [Quasioptimality of maximum-volume cross interpolation of tensors](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379514003711).  

The code is inspired by the following [Matlab Implementation](https://github.com/oseledets/TT-Toolbox/blob/master/cross/greedy2_cross.m).  

Since the code only depends on Numpy, using it in your project simply requires dropping the file `greedy_cross.py` into your project directory.
